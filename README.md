# LitBoard

LitBoard is a custom driver for my Anne Pro 2 keyboard firmware fork.
It currently only sends live weather information so that it can be displayed real-time with rgb effects on the keyboard.

## To-Do List
 - Application integration for gaming, spotify, etc..
 - Andriod integration for displaying notification effects on the keyboard.
